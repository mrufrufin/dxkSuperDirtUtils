# dxkSuperDirtUtils

BootTidal.hs - script I run in ghci to start up tidal (based off BootTidal in Tidal's repo

runtidal - since tidal default binary is now safe-tidal, using this to have it work the old way (change path to BootTidal.hs as needed)

new-synths.scd - supercollider synths for tidal use

superdirt_startup.scd - called from @startup, what I use to start up SuperDirt

@startup - my presonal startup file
